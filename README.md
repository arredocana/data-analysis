# Data Analysis Projects

This is a repository of learning materials, code, and data for my data analysis projects.

If you don't have the necessary software installed to run IPython Notebook, don't fret. You can use [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/) to view a notebook on the web.

For example, if you want to view the notebook `Accidentes de tr√°fico Madrid 2010-2018`, copy the [full link](https://github.com/arredocana/data-analysis/blob/main/Accidentes%20de%20tr%C3%A1fico%20Madrid%202010-2018.ipynb) to the notebook then paste it into [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/arredocana/data-analysis/blob/main/Accidentes%20de%20tr%C3%A1fico%20Madrid%202010-2018.ipynb).
